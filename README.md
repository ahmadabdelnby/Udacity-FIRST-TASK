## LandingPage task 
#### Project Description 
Build a **responsive** good looking LandingPage and practice my new JavaScript knowledge by add:
- Feature of adding new sections with its navigition item.
- Navigition link which points to each section.
- Add active class to onview section.
#### How it works ???
- After page content is loaded it'll dynamically build the navigation bar and add onclick event listener to each of navItems.
- Each navItem has the same title of its linked section.
- You can easily,**smoothly** get to a specific section just by clicking its navItem.
#### I have learned to :
- Build my own development Strategy.
- Do effective search to get informations I need specially from **MDN**.
- Access each element in DOM.
- Link items with each other using Map dataStructure.
